libdummy -- a dummy shared library, for dynamic link hacking

This builds and installs a dummy shared library.  It can be used to satisfy
dynamic link dependencies that are really only required in name only (e.g. code
that links against a library but the use case doesn't involve any of the
library's symbols).  Make symbolic links of such dependencies to libdummy.so.

This is a standard autotools build:

	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ ./configure [--prefix=...]
	$ make
	$ make install

All just to package up `gcc -shared -fPIC -o libdummy.so -xc /dev/null`.

To clean the build products (actually, ALL untracked files), run:

	$ git clean -fdx
